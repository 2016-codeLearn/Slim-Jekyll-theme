		<p><a href="https://github.com/syaning/slim">OHK</a> are my initials, which stands for Omphalus Harkie Kua. I am from Permara a small village within the Kamtai district of the Simbu province in Papua New Guinea. I am the younger brother after my sister. I first came to New Zealand in 1999 on an Aotearoa scholarship to study at Nelson Boys college in Nelson. I became a good Rugby League player over the next few years and finally got selected to play for my KUMUlS (PNG internatonal-team) against the Kangaroos in 2006. My league career ended in Australia after a broken forearm. Since then I came back to NZ and spent the next few years in Wellington stugying but my main love and job have always been to bring up my son who is now 14years old. I say this with pride because I have been a single father since he was 3years old. 
		To put it simply I love creativity in art which is something I enjoy. </p>
